## 📘 About the Project

This project focuses on developing a sophisticated lip-reading system that interprets spoken words from sequences of images. Using Haar Cascade classifiers for face extraction and dlib’s facial landmark detection for lip extraction, we effectively preprocess the data. A train-test split ensures robust model evaluation. The core of the project is a hybrid model combining 3D CNNs, which capture spatial features, and LSTMs, which understand temporal dynamics. Extensive hyperparameter tuning enhances the model’s accuracy. The system has been tested on online videos for accuracy and reliability and includes a live detection feature to showcase real-time capabilities.

## 💾 Dataset: MIRACL-VC1

The **MIRACL-VC1** dataset is structured to facilitate research in visual speech recognition, particularly lip reading. Here's a breakdown of its structure and contents:

#### Data Composition:
- **Video Clips**: The dataset contains short video clips of multiple speakers reciting specific phrases. Each clip captures the upper body, focusing mainly on the face and mouth area.
- **Speakers**: It features several speakers from diverse backgrounds, which helps models generalize across different individuals and speaking styles.
- **Languages**: The dataset is typically in English, though speakers may vary in accents and pronunciations.
- **Phrases**: Each video clip corresponds to one of a predefined set of phrases, which are recited by the speakers. The phrases are usually short and may cover simple daily expressions or numbers.

#### Dataset Contains The Following Words and Phrases:

## 🤖 Model Architecture

![276662464-b1a8a17b-da29-4424-9e5c-b3f51dd07a27](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08cbf766-8553-43ac-a3b7-5c987bce50b8)

1. **3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D CNN)**:
   Several convolutional layers are used, each followed by activation functions and pooling layers to reduce dimensionality while preserving essential features.

2. **Reshape Layer**:
   The tensor dimensions are adjusted to flatten the spatial data into a format that the LSTM can process.

3. **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**:
   One or more LSTM layers are employed to process the sequential data, enabling the model to retain information over time and improve prediction accuracy.

4. **Flatten Layer**:
   This flattens the data without altering its values, preparing it for the next stage.

5. **Dropout Layer**:
    A dropout rate is set (e.g., 0.5) to control the fraction of neurons dropped this prevents overfitting.

6. **Dense Layers**:
    One or more dense layers with activation functions (e.g., softmax for multi-class classification) are used to output the prediction probabilities.
   

By combining these components, the model effectively learns to interpret lip movements, translating them into accurate predictions of spoken words.
