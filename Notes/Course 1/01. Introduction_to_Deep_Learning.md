# Neural Network

- Input goes through a activation function (neuron) to produce desired results
- In simpler terms, the network of this neuron is known as neural network

#### Supervised Learning

- In supervised learning, we have some input data and we want to learn a function that can map that input data to an output.

_Standard Neural Network_: Real Estate, Online Advertising \
_Convolutional Neural Network_: Photo Tagging \
_Recurrent Neural Network_: Speech Recognition, Machine translation

    Why is Deep Learning taking off?
    1. Availability of large amounts of data.
    2. Ability to train large neural networks.
    3. Algorithmic innovations
