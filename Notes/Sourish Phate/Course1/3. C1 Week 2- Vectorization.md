# Vectorization:
- The main idea behind vectorization is to avoid using explicit for loops when working with data for the neural networks to make implementation faster.
- This allows us work with entire arrays or matrices without having to iterate over each element individually which allows us to perform diferent computations much faster.
- Vectorization is quite helpful when working with large datasets.
- In a vectorized implementation, we directly compute the dot product without using an explicit for loop. This is done using built-in functions like `np.dot()` in Python or numpy.

# Vectorizing Logistic Regression:
- Vectorizing logistic regression state of computing the predictions for each training example separately all inputs are stacked horizontally in a matrix 'X'. 
- Using  to which we can use vectorization to compute the predictions (z) for all values at once and then stack/store them into another matrix 'Z' , using a single line of code.
-Similarly all activations can be computed and stored without having to use an explicit for loop.
