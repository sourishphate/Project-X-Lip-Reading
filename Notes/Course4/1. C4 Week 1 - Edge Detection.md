### Convlution in CNNs:
- Convolution in CNNs involves using small filters to detect patterns like edges in images. By sliding the filter over the image and computing element-wise products and sums, you can highlight transitions that correspond to edges.
- Early layers of a CNN might detect edges in images, while later layers detect more complex features like objects or parts of objects.

- Example Setup: Consider a 6x6 grayscale image, represented as a 6x6x1 matrix.
To detect vertical edges, construct a 3x3 filter (also called a kernel) which looks like this:
```
 1  1  1
 0  0  0
-1 -1 -1
```
- Convolution Process:
  - Position the Filter: Place the 3x3 filter on the top-left corner of the image.
  - Element-wise Multiplication and Summation: Multiply each element of the filter by the corresponding element of the image, then sum these products.
  - Store the Result: Place the resulting value in the corresponding position of the output matrix.
  - Move the Filter: Shift the filter one pixel to the right and repeat the process. Continue this for the entire image.

- Output Matrix:
 - After convolving the entire 6x6 image with the 3x3 filter, you get a 4x4 output matrix.
 - This output matrix represents the detected edges, with positive and negative values indicating different edge directions and strengths.

### Edge Detection:
- Given an image, detecting vertical edges might be the first step to understanding the objects within it.
- Edge detection is typically performed in the early layers.
- The goal is to identify the boundaries within images, which can then be used for higher-level feature detection in subsequent layers.

- Learning Filters with Backpropagation:
  - Instead of manually defining filters, CNNs can learn the optimal filters from data.
  - The filter values (parameters) are learned using backpropagation.
  - This approach allows the network to learn not just vertical and horizontal edges but also edges at various angles and other complex features.
