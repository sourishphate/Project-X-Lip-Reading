### One Layered Convolutional network
- We start with a 3D input (e.g., an image with height, width, and depth). We convolve this input with multiple filters (kernels) to produce 2D output image.
- We can use multiple filters to detect different features (e.g., edges, textures).
- For each filter, you add a bias term (a real number) to each element in the feature map.The same bias is added to every value in the 4x4 output image.
- After adding the bias, we apply a non-linearity (e.g., ReLU) to each element in the feature map.
This introduces non-linearity to the model, enabling it to learn more complex patterns.
- We stack the resulting feature maps along the depth dimension. For example, convolving with two filters would result in a 4x4x2 output volume.

#### Notation:
- `f[l] = filter size`
- `p[l] = padding`
- `s[l] = stride`
- `nc[l] = number of filters`
- `Each filter: f[l] * f[l] * nc[l-1]`
- `Activation: a[l] = nh[l] * nw[l] * nc[l]`
- `Weights: f[l] * f[l] * nc[l-1] * nc[l]`
- `Bias: nc[l] - (1,1,1,nc[l])`
- `n[l] = ((n[l-1] + 2p[l] - f[l]) / s[l] ) + 1`
- `Input = nh[l-1] * nw[l-1] * nc[l-1]`
- `Output = nh[l] * nw[l] * nc[l]`

```
- Layer Parameters:
  - If you have 10 filters, each 3x3x3, then each filter has 27 parameters plus 1 bias, making 28 parameters per filter. With 10 filters, you have 28×10=280 parameters.
 - The number of parameters remains constant regardless of the input size. This characteristic helps in reducing the risk of overfitting.

### Pooling Layers:
- Max Pooling:
  - Max pooling is a type of pooling operation where you take the maximum value from a defined region of the input and this value is representative of that region when the input is being processed in the CNN.
  - This reduces the dimensions of the input while keeping the most important information.

- Example:
  - Suppose we have a 4×4 input and you want to apply max pooling with a 2×2 filter and a stride of 2.
  - The input is divided into 2×2 regions. For each region, the maximum value is taken to form the output.

- Average Pooling:
  - Average pooling takes the average value from a defined region of the input instead of the maximum value.
  - Average pooling helps in reducing the impact of outliers or extreme values in the input data.
  - It can be useful in certain situations, such as reducing the dimensions of a feature map in deeper layers of the network.
  - Example: For a 2×2 region, the average value is computed and used as the output.

Hyperparameters:
Filter Size (F): The size of the region over which pooling is applied. 
Stride (S): The step size by which the filter moves across the input.
