## Semantic Segmentation with U-net:
- Semantic segmentation is a computer vision algorithm that helps us understand and label every single pixel in an image. It goes beyond just detecting objects or drawing bounding boxes around them.
- Semantic segmentation labels each pixel in an image, determining if it belongs to an object and which object it is.
